# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This repository contains a Handwritten Digit Recognition project using deep learning. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and real-time digit recognition using OpenCV.

Features:

Handwritten digit recognition using CNN
Preprocessing and resizing of drawn digits
Real-time prediction with OpenCV and Tkinter/Streamlit
Model training and evaluation on the MNIST dataset
Deployment support for web or desktop applications
